\section{Project context}

In this part, we will present the main issue, a study of the existing solutions, our project’s
goals as well as the different steps of the project.

\subsection{Main issue}
The primary challenge in the field of email marketing is the creation and management of effective email campaigns. This involves several aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Email Creation:} The process of creating an email should be intuitive and efficient. Currently, many tools require knowledge of HTML and CSS for customization, which can be a barrier for non-technical users.

\item \textbf{Customization:} Users should be able to easily customize their emails to fit their brand and message. This includes the ability to change styles, add elements, and adjust layouts.

\item \textbf{Campaign Management:} Managing an email campaign involves sending out emails, scheduling them, and segmenting the audience. These tasks should be easy to perform and manage within the tool.

\item \textbf{Tracking:} Once an email campaign is sent out, it's crucial to track its performance. This includes open rates, click-through rates, and conversions. The tool should provide comprehensive tracking and analytics.

\item \textbf{Usability:} The tool should be user-friendly, with a clean interface and clear instructions. It should cater to both beginners and advanced users, offering simplicity without compromising on features.
\end{itemize}

The lack of a tool that effectively addresses all these aspects is the main issue we aim to solve with our SaaS email marketing application.



\subsection{Analysis of the existing solutions}

\subsubsection{HubSpot}

\end{figure}

While HubSpot is a comprehensive platform for email marketing, it has several limitations that can affect its usability and effectiveness:

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Limited Free Version:} The free version of HubSpot’s email marketing tool is limited. You can only send 2,000 emails per month. Additionally, you cannot connect to a custom email sending domain. This means your emails will show “via HubSpot” in the sender area and the footer of your email will have a HubSpot logo.

\item \textbf{Sending Limits:} HubSpot’s send limits vary based on each email provider’s limit. For instance, Gmail Free allows 350 emails per day, Google Apps, Office 365, Exchange inbox, and Generic inbox allow 1000 emails per day.

\item \textbf{CRM Limitations:} There are major limitations for sales functionality in the free CRM. These include only 15 minutes of calling per user, per month, no inbound calling, HubSpot branding on emails, only one sales pipeline, and no email automation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Constant Contact}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \label{Constant Contact Logo}
\end{figure}

Constant Contact, despite its popularity, also has its drawbacks:

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inflexible Email Editor:} The email editor is not as flexible or intuitive as users might prefer, which can make the process of creating emails more time-consuming and less efficient.
\item \textbf{Limited Tracking Features:} The tracking features, while useful, do not offer as much depth as other tools. This can limit user's ability to fully understand and optimize their email campaigns.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{10pt}

In summary, both MailChimp and Constant Contact have significant limitations that can hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of email marketing. Our proposed solution aims to address these limitations by offering a more intuitive and flexible email builder, more customizable design options, and more accessible yet comprehensive campaign tracking.
