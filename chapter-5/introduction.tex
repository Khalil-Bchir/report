This chapter provides a comprehensive look into the last sprint of our project. We begin by defining the tasks in our Backlog, followed by a detailed Functional Specification which includes a Use Case Diagram and a Textual Description of Use Cases. We then delve into the Design aspect, providing Detailed Sequence Diagrams and a Class Diagram. The Implementation section discusses the creation of an Event Dashboard Interface.
