\section{Functional Specification}

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the system's functionality. It includes a use case diagram illustrating the system's interactions and a detailed textual description of each use case.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}

Figure \ref{fig:Sprint 3 Use Case Diagram} offers us an overview by presenting a visual description of the functional
behaviour of our tool during the third sprint. This diagram sums up the interactions among the actors and the
diverse use cases within the system.
