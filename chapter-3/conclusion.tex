In this chapter, we outlined the Sprint 1 Backlog for our email marketing tool project. The tasks focus on developing fundamental features like user registration, authentication, email builder capabilities, and email sending functionalities. Prioritizing these components aims to establish a solid foundation for the application, enabling users to efficiently create, customize, and manage email campaigns. The structured approach and clear task delineation will facilitate effective teamwork and progress tracking, setting the stage for successful project execution and subsequent development phases.
