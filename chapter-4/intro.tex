\subsubsection{Audience Management}

Audience management features were added to allow users to manage their email recipients. This includes adding, removing, and updating recipients, as well as segmenting the audience for targeted campaigns.

\subsubsection{Organization and Roles Management}

To accommodate different user roles within an organization, I implemented a roles management system. This allows for different access levels and permissions for users depending on their role within the organization.
